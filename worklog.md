Task ID: rebuild-exams-2
Agent: main (Super Z)
Task: Restore df0108f examination module, then critically rebuild — fix all errors, remove dead code, wire all generators, polish UI/UX, add CBSE/UP board + class 6-10 + 11-12 stream support.

Work Log:

### Phase 0: Restore baseline (df0108f)
- Restored all exam components, API routes, lib files, Prisma schema, and seed.ts from /tmp/exam-backup (commit df0108f state).
- Ran `prisma format && generate && db push` to sync DB.
- Verified dev server starts clean on PID.

### Phase 1: Deep audit (delegated to Explore subagent)
- Audited ~10.9 KLOC of exam code (28 components + 11 lib files + 24 API routes + 13 Prisma models).
- Identified 10 critical bugs, 9 dead legacy files (~1100 LOC), 4 file duplications, 6 missing CBSE/UP features, 8 UI/UX issues, 5 schema redundancies.
- Produced prioritized action list used as input for the rebuild.

### Phase 2: Delete dead code (~1100 LOC)
- Deleted 9 legacy mock-data component files: `data.tsx`, `kpi-row.tsx`, `analytics-row.tsx`, `schedule.tsx`, `gradebook.tsx`, `shared.tsx`, `create-exam-dialog.tsx`, `exam-details-dialog.tsx`, `results-dialog.tsx`.
- Deleted unused `src/app/api/exam-papers/route.ts`.

### Phase 3a: Schema additions (additive only)
- Added `School.board` field (`@default("CBSE")`).
- Added `Class.stream` field (Science-PCM/PCB/PCMB, Commerce, Humanities, General).
- Made `ExamScheduleItem.subjectId` non-nullable (was `String?`) — enforces consistency with ExamSubjectConfig.
- Made `ExamAttendance.subjectId` non-nullable (was `String?`) — fixes the `__no_subject__` sentinel bug that prevented upserts from ever updating.

### Phase 3b: Curriculum data
- Created `src/lib/exams/curriculum.ts` with 6 subject presets:
  - MIDDLE_SCHOOL_SUBJECTS (class 6-8): Hindi, English, Maths, Science, SST, Sanskrit, CS, Arts, PE
  - SECONDARY_SUBJECTS (class 9-10): CBSE/UP board pattern
  - SCIENCE_PCM_SUBJECTS, SCIENCE_PCB_SUBJECTS, SCIENCE_PCMB_SUBJECTS (class 11-12 Science streams)
  - COMMERCE_SUBJECTS, HUMANITIES_SUBJECTS (class 11-12 Commerce/Humanities)
- Added `suggestSubjectsForClass(gradeLevel, stream)` helper used by Create Exam "Suggest" button.

### Phase 3c: Wire GradeScale + ExamRule keys + AdmitCardConfig + ReportCardConfig + school info in PDFs
- Updated `result-engine.ts::computeAllResults` and `computeAnalytics` to accept an optional `gradeScale` parameter.
- Updated `service.ts::getResultsForClass` to fetch school-configured GradeScale rows and pass them to the result engine — GradeScale edits in Settings now actually affect computed grades.
- Updated `service-extended.ts::computeAutoOutcomes` to read `compartmentThreshold` and `retestThreshold` from `ExamRule` table (was hardcoded to 1 and 2).
- Updated `service-extended.ts::applyGraceMarks` to enforce `graceMarksLimit` from ExamRule (default 5) AND prevent grace from exceeding max marks.
- Created `src/lib/exams/pdf.ts` — merged `exams-pdf-real.ts` + `exams-pdf-extended.ts` into one file.
- All PDF generators now take `SchoolContextDTO` parameter (no more hardcoded "Demo School of Scholario").
- `generateBatchAdmitCardPDF` honors `AdmitCardConfigDTO` toggles (showPhoto, showRollNumber, showRoom, showSeatNumber, showTimetable, showInstructions, showQrCode).
- `generateStudentReportCardPDF` honors `ReportCardConfigDTO` toggles (showRank, showPercentage, showGrade, showRemarks, showClassTeacherSign, showPrincipalSign).
- Created `/api/exams/school-context` endpoint that returns school info (name, address, board, etc.).
- Created `use-pdf-context.ts` hook that fetches school context.

### Phase 3d: Auto status transitions
- `service.ts::addScheduleItem`: Auto-transitions Draft → Scheduled when first schedule item is added.
- `service.ts::setMark`: Auto-transitions Scheduled → Ongoing when first mark is entered.
- `service.ts::declareResults`: Already auto-flips status to Completed (was already there).

### Phase 2: Critical bug fixes
- **Bug §3.1 (multi-class subjects)**: `create-exam-fullscreen.tsx` was auto-populating union of all subjects from selected classes, breaking validation when classes had different subject sets. Now uses INTERSECTION (only subjects common to ALL selected classes). Also filters `subjectsByClass` and `schedule` per-class so subjects missing from a class don't cause validation errors.
- **Bug §3.2 (false-positive conflict)**: `service.ts::addScheduleItem` was matching `room: undefined` as "skip filter" and accidentally flagging all same-date+time items as conflicts. Rewrote with overlap-aware detection (timeOverlaps helper), checks only when room is actually set, and includes invigilator overlap.
- **Bug §3.4 (missing DELETE)**: Added DELETE handler to `/api/exams/[id]/schedule/items/[itemId]/route.ts` that calls `service.ts::deleteScheduleItem`. Re-exported `deleteScheduleItem` from `service-extended.ts` for single-import-surface.
- **Bug §3.5 (empty classId)**: `service-extended.ts::overrideOutcome` was writing `classId: ''` for new outcomes. Now fetches student's actual classId via `db.student.findUnique` before creating.
- **Bug §3.6 (sentinel)**: `service-extended.ts::markExamAttendance` used `__no_subject__` sentinel to satisfy unique constraint — but Prisma stored null, so upserts always INSERTed. Made `subjectId` required (also fixed in schema), removed sentinel.
- **Bug §5.7 (subject picker UX)**: Subject picker showed "available subjects" picker + "No subjects selected" empty state simultaneously. Now mutually exclusive — picker only shows when `availableSubjects.length > 0`, empty state only when `selectedSubjects.length === 0`.
- **Bug §5.1 (header/footer overlap)**: Removed `-mt-4 -mx-4 sm:-mx-6` negative-margin hack from both `create-exam-fullscreen.tsx` and `exam-workspace.tsx`. Container now uses clean `flex flex-col h-full` without negative margins.
- Added Theory + Practical ≠ Maximum Marks warning in Create Exam form.

### Phase 4: Consolidation
- Created `src/lib/exams/api-client.ts` — shared `api<T>()` fetch wrapper (eliminated 3 near-identical copies in use-exams.ts, use-exams-extended.ts, use-exam-settings.ts). Unwraps `{ok: true, data: T}` envelope automatically.
- Moved ALL DTOs to `src/lib/exams/types.ts`:
  - SeatAssignmentDTO, ExamAttendanceDTO, ResultOutcomeDTO, CsvImportRow, CsvImportResult, AdmitCardStudent (was duplicated in service-extended.ts + use-exams-extended.ts)
  - ExamTypeConfigDTO, GradeScaleDTO, AdmitCardConfigDTO, ReportCardConfigDTO (was duplicated in settings-service.ts + use-exam-settings.ts)
  - SchoolContextDTO (new)
- Cleaned `settings-service.ts` to import DTOs from types.ts (no local definitions).
- Cleaned `use-exam-settings.ts` to import DTOs from types.ts.
- Cleaned `use-exams-extended.ts` to import DTOs from types.ts and re-export for backward compat.
- Merged `exams-pdf-real.ts` + `exams-pdf-extended.ts` → `src/lib/exams/pdf.ts` (one file, shared helpers, school-aware).
- Renamed `GRADE_BOUNDARIES` → `DEFAULT_GRADE_BOUNDARIES` (clearer naming — it's the fallback when school has no GradeScale rows).

### Phase 5: UI polish
- **Top-level tabs**: Reduced from 7 → 4 (Overview, Exams, Reports, Settings). Removed duplicate Schedule/Marks/Results tabs that already exist in the Exam Workspace. No duplication.
- **Workspace tabs**: Grouped 10 sections into 3 visual groups (Setup / Execution / Post-Exam) using a custom grouped-segmented-control with a `•` separator between groups.
- **Status badges**: Infinite `animate-ping` animations on LIVE badges now respect `prefers-reduced-motion` via `motion-reduce:animate-none` class.
- **InlineLoading**: Now uses framer-motion's `useReducedMotion` hook — spinner is disabled when user prefers reduced motion.
- **Subject picker**: Animated dropdown (height animation), chip animations (layout + scale on enter/exit), helper note for multi-class selection.
- **Class cards**: Show stream (e.g. "Science-PCM") when set, fall back to section.

### Verification (E2E HTTP workflow test, 16 steps)
Ran `scripts/e2e-exam-workflow.mjs` — all 16 steps passed:
1. ✓ Login
2. ✓ School context (Demo School of Scholario, CBSE)
3. ✓ List exams + classes (6 exams, 2 classes, 6 subjects in Grade 10-A)
4. ✓ Create exam (1 class, 3 subjects, 24 marks rows auto-created for 8 students)
5. ✓ Add schedule item — exam status auto-transitioned Draft → Scheduled
6. ✓ Conflict detection (same class at same time correctly rejected)
7. ✓ Fetch marks (8 rows)
8. ✓ Set mark (75/100) — exam status auto-transitioned Scheduled → Ongoing
9. ✓ Mark > max rejected ("Marks cannot exceed maximum (100)")
10. ✓ Results computed (8 students, analytics with passRate, avg%, grade distribution)
11. ✓ Seating generated (8 seats for 8 students)
12. ✓ Auto attendance (auto-mark from marks)
13. ✓ Auto outcomes (8 students computed, reads ExamRule thresholds)
14. ✓ Grace limit enforced (grace of 10 rejected — limit=5 from ExamRule)
15. ✓ Audit log (5 entries capturing all actions)
16. ✓ Cleanup (delete exam)
